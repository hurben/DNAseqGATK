visit ANNOVAR website at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar for more exmaple.

Please cite ANNOVAR if you use it in your research (Wang K, Li M, Hakonarson H. ANNOVAR: Functional annotation of genetic variants from next-generation sequencing data, Nucleic Acids Research, 38:e164, 2010). I spent tremendous amount of time and effort to maintain this tool, and your citation really means a lot to me.

ex1.human: a simple example with a few variants (in hg18 coordinate)
ex1_hg19.human: a simple example with a few variants (in hg19 coordinate)

example.simple_region: a file containing a list of genomic regions in sample format (for use in retrieve_seq_from_fasta.pl)
example.tab_region: a flie containing a list of genomic regions in tab-delimited format (for use in retrieve_seq_from_fasta.pl)
humandb/hg18_example_db_generic.txt: an example file for generic database
humandb/hg18_example_db_gff3.txt: an example file for GFF3 database

grantham.matrix: a matrix file containing GRANTHAM scores for gene-based annotation
humandb/genometrax-sample-files-gff: a directory containing several "sample" GFF files provided by BioBase
humandb/hg19_MT_GRCh37_ensGene.txt and humandb/hg19_MT_GRCh37_ensGene.fa: mitochondria sequence for the NC_012920 contig. If you align your sequence data using 1000 Genomes Project reference FASTA file, then you should use this file for annotating mitochondria variants, since UCSC used NC_001807 for annotating mitochondria.
